The Product roadmap is the source of truth for the allocation of internal resources aimed at building products. These resources include but are not limited to: engineering, product and design cycles. The business should expect deliverables as a result and teams should be held accountable to do as they say. Executing on roadmaps is how EPDD teams build trust; it’s how teams stay focused on the goal; and how the organization incrementally evolves toward an envisioned future.

Roadmaps can be thought of as a train. The success of a train is that (1) it arrives at it’s desination on time, (2) with the promised cargo. If it’s late, or missing cargo the train has not done its job. Once a train leaves the station it will not go back for forgotten items.

There are two dimensions to a roadmap: (1) the planning, and (2) the execution.
Let’s take each in turn.

### Planning

As such the planning process of roadmaps is critical. To put numbers behind this, at Meta it would be typical for PMs to spend 6 weeks months every half planning (that is, 25% of any execution period would be spent planning. Lincoln went further: if I only had an hour to chop down a tree, I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe, or 75%). For example, if there is a large customer launch coincident with a roadmap period, then planning should account for this. A big part of the job of Product teams is to ensure the roadmap structure was setup for success. So we have a range between 25%-75% planning: execution. 

There's a strong tendency to blame poor execution on, well, an inability to move fast or general ineptitude. The likelier explanation is that without planning execution will go poorly without planning. Think: a construction crew without a blueprint. Quick, run, beams will fall! 

Bringing this closer to home I’ve observed that seeming unknown unkowns actually could have been better anticipated and accounted for with good planning.
Good planning is NOT only the job of the PM. It’s a team sport.

The roadmap process is not an abstraction. It can be seen as breaking critical ground to lay track for the train that a PM knows is coming. It should account for weather conditions, bandits.  

This does not mean that roadmaps are immutable. A good roadmap should anticipate and buffer for known unknowns. Good planning should surface and allocate resources to neutralize such issues as potential threats to the train’s success.

Of course unknown unknowns happen. That’s life. And only so much is within our control.

Generally speaking (there are exceptions, for example platform teams or hardware etc) a good roadmap is a portfolio of bets with resources allocated intelligently to each, based on their weighting. For example 20% critical bugs, 70% new product development, 10% big bets with low odds of success, but high impact if they do.

### Execution

How do we know if we've executed well? 

### The problem

Seen as trains, our roadmaps suffer a high derailment rate. This leads to high incidence of derailments (again, the promised deliverables did not arrive on time).

### What’s the root cause of derailments?

Here’s a flat list:

- Emergent customer-related issues
- Emergent internal issues (that are not externally driven)
- slower than expected development/execution
- re-work (e.g., sloppy requirements, sloppy development/QA)
- unstable infrastructure

Now, these can actually be classified as knowable vs. unknowable during the planning process.
Let’s take an example case and run it through the machine.

Here I’ll posit that the main culprit is a mix of mis-coordinated planning cycles. That is, the roadmap planning process is blind to external customer factors.

### How might we lower the derailment rate?

If we believe the combination of roadmap planning and frequency of emergent

Of course neither of these issues exist in isolation. The frequency of client-related issues suggests a mis-allocation of resources.

Spend 100% of time bug fixing and handling emergent issues?
