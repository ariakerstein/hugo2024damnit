description: how kernels persist

Key questions:
 1. why are groups more predictable than individuals?
 2.

Why should there be anything? This is not our aim. Nevermind G-d for now.  
Somehow there is a kernel. Our aim is more practical.

The kernels in question here are of the self-replicating type. These replicators are:

- Eukaryotes (multi-celled organisms)
  - DNA
  - RNA
- Prokaryotes (single-celled organisms)
  - bacteria
- Viruses

The brilliance of nature is iterating on kernels. They drift.

Diffusion won Einstein the Nobel Prize (check). The diffusion of particles in a substrate offers a glimpse into our own lives.

Reaction & diffusion. We diffuse, an emergent vortex of ideas/

Group behavior is like chemical reactions. Groups are more predictable than individuals; we can predict the behavior of the overall reaction, but not for the individual atoms. That is, averages over large numbers are predictive.

If we pop the hood and look at this dynamic at the DNA or RNA level

Where does this Kernel originate? Darwin’s insight is into the mechanisms of evolution. Let’s call that drift.

Wolfram’s insight is that the kernel can create the stable system itself.

What are the rules by which this system emerges?

It’s a 3 part system.
 1. Set the kernel
 2. Interact the kernel in a body
 3. Engage the body with the environment
 4. Kill many of the iterations - pruning by selection (predator/prey system)
 5. Leave the winners to procreate
 6. Iterate the system
Note that the kernel persists. The instance perishes.

The kernel I suppose is DNA.
