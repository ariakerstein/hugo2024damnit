Emotions are challenging. As a child I turned them off - at least showing them to the world - they were an achilles heel, a source of weakness in a world that felt hostile. 

But 
as humans imagine a generation that has lost the ability to feel. It might take many generations to relearn those abilities. This is the culture. We learn the abilities. But do we learn how to feel? Or is it the expression of those feelings that we learn? 

Oh how much we take for granted in this life. We assume google search. And now we assume chatGPT - the oracle - will be available for us - that human knowledge takes little effort to obtain. We assume not putting effort into study will result in attainment of knowledge. We assume goodness in our fellow citizens. We assume the rule of law - that we can call the police. We assume the love of our parents. We assume people standing near us will act in the face of injustice. We assume hard work will result in good things - planting trees bears fruit. We assume economic growth. We assume home values will increase. We assume the next generation will build and not destroy. We assume generations will continue - that people will want to have babies, not just sex. We assume selflessness and altruism will always intermingle will the baser instincts. We assume there's always a person that knows better/more than we do, and that wisdom exists. 

Ask: what if these did not hold true? Would you be a candle in the dark?
