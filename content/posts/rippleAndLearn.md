## 1/ Why does speed matter?

Being right and being fast are not mutually exclusive propositions. In the world of business the penalty for being wrong is often forgiveable (in contrast, say to experimenting as a surgeon on the operating table, or a pilot with fancy flying techniques on a cross-continental commercial flight). The trick is to be mostly right, to distinguish between (quoting Jeff Bezos) one-way vs. two-way doors. Moving fast through one-way doors will enable iteration towards the right answer. And finally, learn quickly from each iteration, 

The way I like to think about this is backwards. That is, set a mark 6 months into the future and consider path a vs path b. Ask: which approach will likely produce the more favorable outcome? Sometimes the right approach is to move slowly, deliberately towards the right answer. But often, more often than not, it's better to move fast and iterate.

## 2/ Be bold

An old mentor and I once discussed this topic in regards to experimentation. I summarized our conversation as "ripple and learn". The key is to ripple hard. He literally encouraged me to not make small changes where the impact is hard to assess. Instead, take big swings! Rippling is like perturbing systems and seeing how they respond. It's really akin to gym class where a group of kids hold a large sheet, and then shake it up and down so the balls contained within the perimeter jumble around. To understand the movememnt of the balls it would be smarter to favor a methodical shaking over randomly shaking at will. Done well, over many iterations, this should help cultivate a keen intuition for the experimenters. Future tests will be more targeted and intelligent, producing better results. 

## 3/ What do you do when you don't know what to do?
> Strike while the iron is hot? No, make the iron hot by striking! 

The unforgiveable failure is to have an aim but to not make progress in that direction. As I write these lines I realize I'm literally right now committing this error myself on a few projects. Movement has a way of creating it's own momentum. If you don't know, just go in a direction. The penalty for trying is very low. You've got little to lose!
