I’ve been working on building this blog furiously for the past 4 days with a lot of anguish and false starts. For about half a day I was pulling my hair out (what’s left of it!) as everything was breaking. But I’m really excited about getting this blog up and running. It’s live and I’m proud of the end result. 

# The Journey
I started with Gatsby. That was great but also realized that the amount of Javascript and React I need to know was resulting in weird bugs and breakage. The whole point is to get a good writing flow - it should PROMOTE MORE QUALITY WRITING. This should happen because the input process is smooth - it’s a pleasure to do it. The output should be something I’ll be proud of. This will generate a feedback loop of promoting more writing. 

# Why a static site generator? 
Wouldn’t it be easier just to use Wordpress? Yes it would be. I’ve self-hosted on Wordpress for over 12 years and it’s been great for what it’s for - quick publishing. 

But I’ve also found myself getting frustrated with small things. For example the site is sluggish. There’s too much bloat with all the plugins, updates, and kind of ugly CMS. I forget my login half the time and need to re-auth if I’m on a different computer, etc. There’s no comparison to just cracking open a proper code editor and writing. Writing is a personal process, like walking in the woods. I don’t want some third party GUI spoiling the purity. 

One thing I’m increasingly sensitive to is a ratio I think of as signal/pixel. Buttons have gotten large, javascript somewhat out of control. Call me old fashioned but I want signal damnit! Nothing like simple flows that are understandable and devoid of nonsense. 

# The sweet setup
My flow is basically write either in VS Code or Ulysses (it’s pretty sweet for markdown editing). I’ll push my changes to git. I host on Netlify and setup an automatic pipeline to update any master branch updates. The entire flow from git push to Hugo build to live on site takes less than a minute. 

There’s a truth about life, or at least about my experience with it. That is that when things are easy and comfortable I don’t do well. I get lazy and complacent VERY easily. But the other side is true too - I always rise to the occasion. The trick I’ve learned is I need to engineer those occasions so move in a more favorable direction. 

That means hiding functionality behind a GUI is really bad. I like to open the hood and get my hands dirty. So that means a bit of extra

# What I tried 

 effort is worth it.
