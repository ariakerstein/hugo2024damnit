      <description>Holding onto work too long leads to stagnation, like part of a river branch flowing into a dead end swamp.&#xA;A good outcome for showing work is either some fundamental flaw is exposed or tweaks suggested to optimize it. Either way time (the only non-renewable resource) is preserved. Through a quick personal survey I&amp;rsquo;ve observed that my outcomes tend to be good the majority of the time when I show my work quickly.</description>
