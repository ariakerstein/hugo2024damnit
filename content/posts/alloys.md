## Summary:

Humor breeds confidence; 
Anger breeds urgent desire;
Anxiety is the enemy of performance; 
Experiment to find the right alloy needed to handle expected challenges. 

I learned early on that anger doesn't help a situation. This was an early coping mechanism for a hard family life. I figured all that anger was wasted energy so I went inside - to books, ideas, building stuff. That always fit better and helped me not feel deep anger. So I felt better.

What's the right mental architecture to support such a load? What would be the 
right alloy to use on the structural beams?
Fast forward a few decades and now as a team leader responsible for the work of many people I can't just withdraw to ethereal flow states to cope. There's lots of opportunity for agitation - from above, from within the team, from within me. So I need to deal with it head on.

I only recently realized I've been asking these kinds of questions since I was in high school. On the bus rides to away games I would sit staring out the window, watching the pastoral scenes whizzing past as we traveled to fancy Academies like Exeter, Andover. I would always get so nervous before these games. I had to figure out how to psych myself up for fear of succoming to paralyzing nerves.

I recall specific experiments I would run on myself - thinking whether humor was better than anger. Humor: "I got this" I would try on a frame of humor going into the game vs. a frame of "these people want to murder you and your family".
The whole thing was so meta - the central conscience convincing itself to be/feel differently about a situation.

I've been reflecting on this recently in context of my team. Are the structures I used over the years still appropriate to producing the desired outcomes? The reflections on the bus were compiled at runtime. I find myself writing that source code now to explicitly encode the right mental constructs required to focus maximum time on the tasks at hand. The risk in not doing this is running mental cycles that produce little beyond heat. Not only is that frustrating, but comes at high opportunity cost.
