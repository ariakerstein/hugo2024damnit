      <description>Here’s a Bioinformatics Study annotating the Drosophila Erecta genome as part of a concerted effort to annotate the entire genome. What was really cool about this was tracing the branch points between species - you can literally see the differences at a genetic level (e.g., introns, or non-coding snippets of DNA).&#xA;The study was spearheaded by Washington U. in partnership with SFSU and I participated as part of a graduate class I took in 2007.</description>
