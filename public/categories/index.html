      What is a field of play? Before engaging in play, it&rsquo;s good to obsess over the board. What do I mean? It&rsquo;s been my experience that certain tactile or visceral components will set my mind racing about possibilities. And these possibilities would fire both before and after any daily engagement. The field fuels obsession.
Examples from my experience: In high school I played lacrosse. We would get use of Brown universities astroturf roof (&ldquo;the roof&rdquo;).

      What might a life of full immersion look like? I sometimes think that bliss would be found in single-minded obsession. With so much busyness it’s critical to protect one’s time. I’ve spent too many years flitting and bouncing my attention (intention attendance!) at multiple levels. It’s like a sputtering flame : moment by moment - slack vs. SMS vs. email pings vs. fly-by my desk conversations. Day to day - reacting vs.

      This is what a product manager (any great leader) must do. This is a deceptively simple phrase but there a lot packed in it. This describes the what and the how and the why for achieving success as a team leader.
Enable Enablement happens on multiple levels. Unblock sticking points. On any project there will be many sticking points including: (1) From above (e.g., leadership misalignments), (2) from within (e.g., intra-team process, dynamics, lack of cohesion etc.

      I recently read &ldquo;Scrum&rdquo; and several points hit home. In reflecting on my own intellectual and creative pursuits. While I&rsquo;ve been doing product for well over a decade now there are definitely areas of continued improvement that are needed.
It Causes Frustration It’s like Zeno’s paradox; with each touch there’s a further distance from the finish line. Why? Because the habit of non-finishing accrues. So there’s a lack of urgency that begets further non-finishing patterns.

      Today I reviewed my year. I stared at the sheet of paper - a ledger weighing the good and the bad. As I stared at the page, a question: how many sublime moments did I have? So I added a third column, straight down the the middle of the sheet.
Sublime moments My first observation was there were not as many as I&rsquo;d have thought. Second, these were enabled by removing the steady state background hum of agitations: distraction, judgment and worry, processing all the things.

      Holding onto work too long leads to stagnation, like part of a river branch flowing into a dead end swamp.
A good outcome for showing work is either some fundamental flaw is exposed or tweaks suggested to optimize it. Either way time (the only non-renewable resource) is preserved. Through a quick personal survey I&rsquo;ve observed that my outcomes tend to be good the majority of the time when I show my work quickly.

      We flew back from Boston a few days ago. I’ve encountered my share of turbulence on planes but this was the worst I had ever experienced. The metallic rattling of luggage in the overheads was sickening. I imagined getting torn to bits at 30k feet. I looked down at Lev, my boy, in the next seat. I noticed his thick wavy hair, freckled cheeks – pure boyishness! He was calmly staring at the seat ahead.

      Nature opens her aperture through the consciousness of humans. We are nature, instantiated. The peril is not realizing the window of opportunity that exists for those of us blessed to live outside the survival envelope (in which we spend most of our time on survival-related activities). It’s worth stepping back and considering the absence of hardships we might easily have suffered.
The young have much to learn from the older members of humanity.
