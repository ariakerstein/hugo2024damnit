      <description>If you emphasize the physical side of training you may become superbly conditioned but mentally not advanced at all. On the other hand, if you concentrate on the mental aspect, it is inevitable that the physical side will follow. My golden rule is to train for the mental toughness and not to train for the physical development.&#xA;Herb Elliott (world champion middle distance runner) This race comes at about day 30 in a new role.</description>

      <description>The day begins at 4:30. I must have eaten more than I can remember the previous night. I cooked up a vat of pasta, garlic bread and salad for a few folks including some fellow K-star runners. We watch chariots of fire on the 40” screen while shoveling the food down.&#xA;Out the door I get some green tea and honey at the local Starbucks (a staple for my marathons). On the bus ride over the course I feel disconcertingly unexcited.</description>
