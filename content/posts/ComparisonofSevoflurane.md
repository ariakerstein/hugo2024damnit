Here's a draft paper I wrote (and never got around to submitting) while working as a (molecular biologist) researcher at UCSF: Comparing Sevoflurane with a Sister Anesthetic, CHF2OCH(CF3)2 in Rats. The focus was exploring the possibility of brain metabolite formation in response to inhaled anesthetics. This topic matters since there is a link between exposure to these agents and cognitive impairment in children. Could we perhaps construct anesthetics without those negative effects? 
This study also compares performance of sevoflurane, one of the most popular inhaled anesthetics, to a structurally similar (one atom difference!) variant that offers some promising anesthetic benefits.
