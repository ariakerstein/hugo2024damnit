description: "Sundays drives are the best"

Sunday is the start of the week. It's a day of new
beginnings. This is when I do my weekly planning. And it's a time I do
some evaluation of the previous week. I like doing it this way. It's
the difference between building a life like a rocket-ship vs. a
car. The car has close feedback between the driver and
road/conditions. In contrast the rocket must be planned perfectly at
the outset. I drive. 

## Why not monday?
Monday? Monday is when the rubber hits the road. I always have hated
Monday. You might think that a well-laid plan for the week would make
Monday awesome. So why not? Not sure but my aim is to connect Sunday
awesomeness so it bleeds into Monday. 

Experiment: Attempt to simply focus on priorities by jotting them on an index card - one side. Don’t bother with anything else, just focus on this list to the brutal exclusion of all else. Let’s see how we do. Oh, keep slack turned off :).
