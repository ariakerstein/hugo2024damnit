Anxiety is increased when I’m outside the mix. When I jump into the churning pot of mess I’m really happy. That’s because I’m focused on the problem and struggles at hand, not on the judgments of people. If there’s a hell I’m sure it’s the perceived judgments of people - particularly people in power relative to oneself. 

There’s a very clear delineation in my mind. I can get at it with a simple question: am I focused on the judgments of others or the problem. Am I focused on hitting the ball (what I control), or on the pitcher’s intention (what I don’t control - their desire to strike me out!)? 

Focus on doing good work. Good work is work that’s enjoyed. Do not focus on the people around it. They are enablers of the work - energy givers. If they are energy takers ask yourself why that is.
