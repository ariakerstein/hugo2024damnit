# Notebooks

I was flipping through some old notebooks - I think this one was Calculus 2, a course I particularly enjoyed. The One side had some complex squiggles. And on the other side, an in the margins it was one idea after another. I had forgotten about this sensation of just firing on all cylinders. It was so interesting to me how doing math would light a fire on other sides of my brain. Reading through the notebook I saw poems, company ideas, political ruminations, architectural drawings, marketing slogans for the company. 

These days I'm not doing so much math. On occasion I'll dust off an old textbook, sit down with a yellow pad, pencil and a tea, crack open the book and do problems. Just for fun. 

What I realized is that the end is NOT to become a mathematician, or anything along these lines. Rather, the goal is to prime the pump for ideas. I know that one sure-fire way to get them going is to either:
1. Go running / working out
2. Code or do some form of math/physics. 

Why this is the case is purely a matter of speculation. But what I know is this is a great entry point in terms of motivations/reasons to continue doing these seemingly "wasteful" activities. That's right, I consider these things to be waste without this reframe. Let's see if it helpsn to do more of this!
