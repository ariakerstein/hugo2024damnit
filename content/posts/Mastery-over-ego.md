What interests you? If you trace it back ask yourself if this came from others or from yourself.

Power is a barrier. When you have a manager, a team, it's easy for a switch to happen. In my own career I've seen the worst in my emerge when I switch from a mastery mindset to an ego mindset. I start worrying about optics, shielding, upward communication. This is what's called taking your eye off the ball. And it's been a personal barrier to really doing the work.

Michael Jordan said it was about the fans. The tactics he used to get inside other players heads was in service of greatness and mastery. Jeff Bezos says it's about customers.

The problem is when customers are secondary - abstract or distant. Then the company perimeter/arena dominates.

How can we return to a mastery mindset amidst pressures of reviews and the practical prssures of corporate life?

Sometimes it feels like I'm doing someone else's work. Strangely, this tends to happen on Mondays. I zoom upward to orbit and watch my tiny self operating on the ground. A human pixel.

Then I ask myself: why do I feel this way? Usually the answers are some combination of overwhelm and insecurity/imposter syndrome.

When I feel this way I'll remind myself that my real aspiration is to do G-d's work. What is the work that makes me feel that burning feeling? Could I feel that way about what I'm working on? What makes me feel G-d's pleasure?
