## What might a life of full immersion look like?
I sometimes think that bliss would be found in single-minded obsession. With so much busyness it’s critical to protect one’s time. I’ve spent too many years flitting and bouncing  my attention (intention attendance!) at multiple levels. It’s like a sputtering flame :
moment by moment - slack vs. SMS vs. email pings vs. fly-by my desk conversations.
Day to day - reacting vs. pro-acting. Ask: who’s agenda am I executing? In the world of tech product it’s WAY too easy to focus on the urgent, the politically expedient, the tiger you think you hear in the brush. Nope - focus on the destination. Danger always lurks. Stay the path.
longer term, strategically - no clear aim about what ends I wish to pursue. Opportunities are like YouTube videos; they all look great. But there is not sufficient life in us to view them all!What’s the solution? How might we, as with Newton, be children playing on the shore overturning shells, whatever those might be?

## Solutions (options I’ve used with varying degrees of success)

Moment by moment:
- Turn off the distractions, e.g., close slack
- Single-focus on ONE thing. I have a tendency of wandering, often to fears/what-ifs/recursive judgments (my judgments of other’s perceived judgments - not helpful). To prevent wandering I literally set timers and write, in a notebook, the ONE thing I’m currently focused on. Then I score my attention levels (0-5). Numbers can help.

Daily:
- Write down 2 things you plan to get done. That you MUST get done today. Nothing else happens until those 2 are completed. This helps keep the urgent at bay. It’s important to believe your own judgment about what those important things actually are. This is not always obvious or easy. Personally I’m getting much better about trusting this. Other people’s agendas must be subservient the majority of the time.

Longer-term:
- Set goals at varying time scales. For example I set 5-year, 1-year, quarterly, weekly goals. If that seems like a lot of work, it is. But it’s also fun to consider the magic available to us. We can set our intentions, and bring them to life. This is the gift of having human brains. This is why this topic matters!
- Say Yes, or say no. Let the bigger picture light you on fire!

If I were to distill the above into a simple heuristic I think it would be that whatever one is doing put your full attention to it. Focus
