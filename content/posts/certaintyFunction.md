Writing code is a funny thing. My mindset it totally certain and my inner talk changes – I get into flow. With few exceptions I’m playful and engaged (think Matthew Broderick in war games for a visual snapshot of how I feel). I realized this is how I am when I run as well. And that mindset works with my personality. It’s when I’m at my best: hungry, playful, certain about my ability + some edge.

That’s a bit different than how I typically operate in the domain of people when the likelihood of getting self-conscious and going in unhelpful directions (imposter syndrome, anyone?) is elevated. So what’s funny about it is that my code is buggy (anyway buggier than my inter-personal relationships).
Why I’m bothering to tell you all this is that it doesn’t really matter that the outcome is imperfect. Why? Because the process is pleasurable and because the fundamentals of the process are so strong that means it’s a self-correcting system. Code a bug -> find a bug -> fix the bug (or don’t:)). And my self confidence (paradoxically given I’m not a ninja) is high, thus increasing the likelihood that I’ll enjoy continuing. To put a finer point on this I will get a feature wrong. But I have the confidence that I can figure it out even if I do break something. Positive feedback loops, like compounding interest, always win.

So ask yourself. Are your activities upward spirals? Are there certain domains in which your inner talk is skillful and others where it’s not? Can you self-reflect to understand what the deltas are? Are you intuitive enough to move your self-talking functions from your most skillful domain (see the wheel of life based on Tony Robbins), into other less skillful domains?
