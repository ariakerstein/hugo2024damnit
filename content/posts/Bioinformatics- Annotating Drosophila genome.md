Here’s a Bioinformatics Study annotating the Drosophila Erecta genome as part of a concerted effort to annotate the entire genome. What was really cool about this was tracing the branch points between species - you can literally see the differences at a genetic level (e.g., introns, or non-coding snippets of DNA).  
The study was spearheaded by Washington U. in partnership with SFSU and I participated as part of a graduate class I took in 2007. A link to the pdf version is here [annotating drosophila genome][1].
