I work in fits and starts. But lately I've felt the need to write again. Why? Not sure. Perhaps it's a longing of some sort. What's the point of longing? I suppose longing is the word that describes all frenetic energy of humans, their constructs, the activities within those constructs. But we must pop out of these containers. This is what meditation/mindfulness are about. But to see the container for what it is - not easy. My own attempts at meditation have been largely unfruitful due to an inability to escape that container. 
As a thought experiment consider which alternative containers you might have inhabited, should you have been more in a different time and place. What would your current anxieties, hopes and dreams feel like? Movies are good to prompt this type of thinking. 

Dreams are like shifting sands of consciousness.
