# Question
Why does American society so polarized when objectively life is good for people (material wealth, money, food, access)?
I see this in my own family and am grappling to understand the root cause at a micro perspective. And I'd like to play out where this might lead with a prediction. 

# decomposition & metrics
- metric: HHI divisions growing. It's about relative, not absolutes
- hours in -- "boredom apps"
- Violence is down
- Media: from monolithic => fractal

# Speculation
- how real are these divisions anyway?
- Media consumption and frames
- 
- Ferguson: Jews were deeply integrated into German society. Indeed that tight integration was one reason for the violence. There is no country more integrated than the United States. 
- metric: HHI divisions growing. It's about relative, not absolutes
- Divided education levels mean prospects are unevenly distributed
- Complexity is polarizing: many people cannot/will not face it; easy answers are more appealing
- language: 
	+ left vs. right
	+ pronouns
	+ when too much is good we forget the water we swim in. Nature abhors a vacuum; if we don't need to struggle for life we'll focus on trivialities
