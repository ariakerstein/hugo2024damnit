      Emotions are challenging. As a child I turned them off - at least showing them to the world - they were an achilles heel, a source of weakness in a world that felt hostile.
But as humans imagine a generation that has lost the ability to feel. It might take many generations to relearn those abilities. This is the culture. We learn the abilities. But do we learn how to feel?

      What is a field of play? Before engaging in play, it&rsquo;s good to obsess over the board. What do I mean? It&rsquo;s been my experience that certain tactile or visceral components will set my mind racing about possibilities. And these possibilities would fire both before and after any daily engagement.

Yom Kippur is the Jewish response to solving this issue and putting it on the calendar.
March is about closing open loops of projects. Here’s one – the radio that’s sitting in my basement. We got 90% of the way done then put it aside and that was that.

      Nature opens her aperture through the consciousness of humans. We are nature, instantiated. The peril is not realizing the window of opportunity that exists for those of us blessed to live outside the survival envelope (in which we spend most of our time on survival-related activities). It’s worth stepping back and considering the absence of hardships we might easily have suffered.
The young have much to learn from the older members of humanity.

      The day begins at 4:30. I must have eaten more than I can remember the previous night. I cooked up a vat of pasta, garlic bread and salad for a few folks including some fellow K-star runners. We watch chariots of fire on the 40” screen while shoveling the food down.
Out the door I get some green tea and honey at the local Starbucks (a staple for my marathons). On the bus ride over the course I feel disconcertingly unexcited.

      The frisbee veers into the brush. Lua and I walk over. As we crouch over the planter box I look down and notice green protruding jaws cup two tablespoons of water. As I inch closer, I notice white spots, patterns and tiny teeth along the edges of the leaves.
I’m somewhat horrified, not by the threat of frozen violence, but rather by my lack of awareness about plants. I love nature.

      On the way to seeing her I jotted down the memories, talking point bullets in my notebook: the warm feeling from sitting on the carpet as a kid, the smell of spaghetti and meatballs permeating the air on a random weeknight; coming over for breakfast across the driveway for Kasha; etc. I wanted to sit with her and share those memories, I knew by this point she wasn’t likely to be lucid but still, maybe she could hear/recognize my voice.

      Holding onto work too long leads to stagnation, like part of a river branch flowing into a dead end swamp.
A good outcome for showing work is either some fundamental flaw is exposed or tweaks suggested to optimize it. Either way time (the only non-renewable resource) is preserved. Through a quick personal survey I&rsquo;ve observed that my outcomes tend to be good the majority of the time when I show my work quickly.

      There are several flavors of exhaustion. Here’s the taxonomy.
Exhaustion by going shallow This is my enemy. This is what I’ve been doing the past few days as I onboard at a new company (oh, I’m now at Facebook!). But I’m doing a million little things, deep on none. It can be draining. But I know it’s finite. That hasn’t always been the case. I would debilitate myself, confusing activity for outcomes.

      We flew back from Boston a few days ago. I’ve encountered my share of turbulence on planes but this was the worst I had ever experienced. The metallic rattling of luggage in the overheads was sickening. I imagined getting torn to bits at 30k feet. I looked down at Lev, my boy, in the next seat. I noticed his thick wavy hair, freckled cheeks – pure boyishness! He was calmly staring at the seat ahead.

      If you emphasize the physical side of training you may become superbly conditioned but mentally not advanced at all. On the other hand, if you concentrate on the mental aspect, it is inevitable that the physical side will follow. My golden rule is to train for the mental toughness and not to train for the physical development.

How do epigenetic modifications influence evolution? why do anesthetics affect virtually all life forms like a magic light switch on consciousness?

      Here&rsquo;s a draft paper I wrote (and never got around to submitting) while working as a (molecular biologist) researcher at UCSF: Comparing Sevoflurane with a Sister Anesthetic, CHF2OCH(CF3)2 in Rats. The focus was exploring the possibility of brain metabolite formation in response to inhaled anesthetics. This topic matters since there is a link between exposure to these agents and cognitive impairment in children. Could we perhaps construct anesthetics without those negative effects?

      Notes from a journal club presentation I gave to the Mathematics, Chemistry and Molecular Biology faculty in 2007. This was an elegant study, called on the effect of Force on Mononucleosomal Dynamics. Basically the investigators used optical tweezers to perturb DNA to see about the coiling forces involved in wrapping and unwrapping DNA. This is important since DNA - which is often coiled or otherwise folded - must be accessed with very specific timing for things like genes to be transcribed to make functional proteins out of them.

      An Experimental Design I wrote as a researcher at UCSF proposing the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to elucidate the mechanisms by which inhaled anesthetics work. More specifically the idea is to infuse siRNA into the lumbar region of the spinal cord of rat to perturb the receptors thought to be responsible for inducing general anesthesia (e.g., Glycine, NMDA, etc.). siRNA experiment proposal
The main benefit of this approach is that it bypasses the need to engineer genetic mutant strains (say, of mice - which we also did).

Let me start with a few broad strokes to try and summarize some of the book&rsquo;s findings:
Ferguson lists three ingredients as key predictive indicators of the descent of societies into genocide and brutal conflict of the type seen over and again throughout the past century (and more recently in Yugoslavia and Rwanda).
