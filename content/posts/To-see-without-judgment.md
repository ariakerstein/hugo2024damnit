I engage with the present moment - in this case, staring at my daughters face. And there's no background noise - remarkable. I'm calm, just...being. It's peace. Not by addition, rather by subtraction! The removal of cruff leaves the desired state. This is the definition of liberation. It's freedom from the tyranny of the self, the judgments, the swirling vortex of background noise. 
I write this post as a trigger, a reminder, a love-note to self. Self: it *is* possible to be here now. Remember that. 
If I had one wish for my future self - Ari in 2021 (and all of you!) - I think this would be it. Be. Here. Now. Itâ€™s the greatest place on earth. Get it for free.
