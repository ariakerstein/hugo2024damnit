      This is what a product manager (any great leader) must do. This is a deceptively simple phrase but there a lot packed in it. This describes the what and the how and the why for achieving success as a team leader.
Enable Enablement happens on multiple levels. Unblock sticking points. On any project there will be many sticking points including: (1) From above (e.g., leadership misalignments), (2) from within (e.g., intra-team process, dynamics, lack of cohesion etc.

      There are several flavors of exhaustion. Here’s the taxonomy.
Exhaustion by going shallow This is my enemy. This is what I’ve been doing the past few days as I onboard at a new company (oh, I’m now at Facebook!). But I’m doing a million little things, deep on none. It can be draining. But I know it’s finite. That hasn’t always been the case. I would debilitate myself, confusing activity for outcomes.

      We flew back from Boston a few days ago. I’ve encountered my share of turbulence on planes but this was the worst I had ever experienced. The metallic rattling of luggage in the overheads was sickening. I imagined getting torn to bits at 30k feet. I looked down at Lev, my boy, in the next seat. I noticed his thick wavy hair, freckled cheeks – pure boyishness! He was calmly staring at the seat ahead.

      Yesterday Lua turned 3 years old. She helped me get through my dark days. She still does. And her ability to navigate people (already!) amazes me. She has such a giant personality. Definitely a proud daddy. I’ve had this habit for a long time where I write down my thought process for decisions and big events. I’ll periodically review them to either understand flaws/gaps in my thinking with the benefit of hindsight, or pat myself on the back for my prescience (not frequent, but it sometimes happens).

      If you asked me as a teenager I would have told you the payoff of workouts was in the primal aspects of the activity, the immediate feelings. It was about seeing how hard I could push the body. All that adolescent aggression had to get channelled somehow. This was easy and satisfying. It was about adrenaline, the ‘pump’.
Later it was about the effects of the workout, over a longer time period, seeing the progress of lifting x yesterday, x+1 today.

Then, a stocatto barrage of keystrokes: Simulation number 39…no change from 38…The pX protein displays kinetics suggesting diffusion as the primary mechanic of nucleus traversal. In the presence of DNA breaks the molecular kinetics change and the molecule activates a cascade catalyzing repair complex formation…

      If you emphasize the physical side of training you may become superbly conditioned but mentally not advanced at all. On the other hand, if you concentrate on the mental aspect, it is inevitable that the physical side will follow. My golden rule is to train for the mental toughness and not to train for the physical development.

        Leaving Science

      I went into science to remain a child. Where else can exploration for its own sake be considered a value? I did an MS in molecular biology and research in mathematics. I wanted to establish a foundation for understanding how things work. In a sense I wanted to learn how to learn. But I also worked on cool questions like:
How do epigenetic modifications influence evolution? why do anesthetics affect virtually all life forms like a magic light switch on consciousness?

      Here&rsquo;s a draft paper I wrote (and never got around to submitting) while working as a (molecular biologist) researcher at UCSF: Comparing Sevoflurane with a Sister Anesthetic, CHF2OCH(CF3)2 in Rats. The focus was exploring the possibility of brain metabolite formation in response to inhaled anesthetics. This topic matters since there is a link between exposure to these agents and cognitive impairment in children. Could we perhaps construct anesthetics without those negative effects?
